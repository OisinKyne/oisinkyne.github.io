			I have been fortunate enough to avail of many different competitions and events throughout my second level education and into my third level. In a not so brief list, some of my proudest achievements include: 
			<!--I have been fortunate enough to have received a number of scholarships to further my study of computer science at UCD. My most notable award and my proudest achievement to date is the Naughton Foundation scholarship. I have also been a member of UCD's Bord Na Gaeilge's scéim cónaithe for two consecutive years from 2013-2015. While living in the scéim I promoted the use of Irish on campus and in society, through organising events through Irish to speaking it on a daily basis. UCD also named me a UCD entrance scholar for my Leaving Certificate results. </p>
<p>During my transition year I took part in a competition called the <a href="http://www.firstlegoleague.org/">FIRST Lego League</a> with five other team mates from my school. The FLL is comprised of two main sections; a robotics challenge and a research project. 140,000 students from 52 different countries compete annually. My team and I were extremely successful in this competition. We placed 1st in the Irish final, proceeded to place first in the UK and Ireland final and went on to represent Ireland and the UK in the World Finals in St. Louis, MI where we won "The Most Inspirational Team" award. Our research project was an Android app called iCollapse. We worked with SAP's innovation centre in Dublin to develop this product further. The completed app was submitted by three of my team mates into the BT young scientist where it went on to win the Google Trailblazer Award-->

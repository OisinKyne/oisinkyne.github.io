Web Design Project Notes:

Site Layout:
{
	Home Page:
		- Rolling animation of photos.
		- Menu buttons that darken on a hover.

	(The House:)?
		- Facilites + Photos

	The Area:
		- Images from around Mayo
		- Local History?
	Getting Here:
		- Textual directions from places.
		- Embed Google Maps onto page.

	Local Attractions:
		- Embedded Youtube links
		- Pretty 3x3 squares w/ rounded edges for images of places to go around the area and a link to the site.

	Image Gallery:
		- Pop up images/spotlight would be so cool.

	Contact Us:
		- Form that sends an email to me would be preferable.
		- Normal contact details also.
}

Colour Scheme: 
{
	Sans serif font with the TNR A's. I like those a's. This font even.
	White background with a faint image. Body should be white with a drop shadow onto the background.
	I'm thinking gray buttons with darker gray hovering.

	A font size button could be really cool. As could multiple languages but I don't know how feasible that could be.
